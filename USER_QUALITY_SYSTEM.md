# User-Centric Quality System

**Core Principle**: Musical quality is not universal - it's personal, contextual, and user-defined. The system learns and adapts to each user's unique quality preferences rather than trying to impose universal standards.

## üéØ The User-Centric Approach

### Why User-Centric Quality?

1. **Musical Taste is Personal**: A jazz musician's idea of "good" is completely different from a metal guitarist's
2. **Context Matters**: What sounds good in a ballad vs. a dance track vs. a film score is entirely different
3. **User Control is Essential**: The user is the ultimate judge of what works for their creative vision
4. **Learning from User Behavior**: The system should learn what each user considers "quality" through their interactions

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### User Quality Profile System

```python

        self.accepted_patterns = []          # Patterns user kept
        self.quality_threshold = 0.7         # User-adjustable quality threshold
        self.learning_enabled = True         # Whether to learn from user behavior
        self.context_preferences = {}        # Preferences by musical context
    
    def learn_from_feedback(self, pattern, user_rating, feedback):
