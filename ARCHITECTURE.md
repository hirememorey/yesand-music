## Key Design Decisions

### Universal Note Format
**Decision**: Use consistent dictionary format for all MIDI data
```python
{
    'pitch': int,                    # MIDI note number
    'velocity': int,                 # Note velocity (0-127)
    'start_time_seconds': float,     # Start time in seconds
    'duration_seconds': float,       # Note duration in seconds
    'track_index': int              # Track number
}
```

**Rationale**: 
- Avoids "Black Box Dependency Problem" with heavy MIDI libraries
- Enables pure functions in analysis layer
- Simplifies testing and debugging
- Provides consistent interface across all components
