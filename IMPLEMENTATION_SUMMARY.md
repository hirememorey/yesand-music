```

### After (Real-Time)
```
Ardour OSC → Project State Capture → LLM Enhancement → MIDI Generation → Ardour Import
```

## Critical Pre-Mortem Insight Addressed

The implementation addresses the critical pre-mortem insight about real-time state capture:

**Problem**: File-based integration would provide stale data, leading to user distrust and poor musical coherence.

**Solution**: Real-time OSC monitoring ensures musicians always work with current project state for accurate and relevant enhancements.
