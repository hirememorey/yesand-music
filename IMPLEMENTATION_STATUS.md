## Implementation Guide

### For New Developers
1. **Read**: [MIDI_TO_JSON_IMPLEMENTATION.md](MIDI_TO_JSON_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for complete implementation guide
2. **Follow**: Step-by-step implementation plan
3. **Test**: Each phase independently before moving to next
4. **Reference**: Existing codebase for patterns and architecture

### Key Files to Create
```
music_generator/
â”œâ”€â”€ midi_generator.py              # Core MIDI generation
â”œâ”€â”€ musical_notation_converter.py  # MIDI to JSON conversion
â”œâ”€â”€ openai_music_client.py        # OpenAI integration
â”œâ”€â”€ ardour_midi_extractor.py      # Ardour context extraction
â”œâ”€â”€ context_assembler.py          # Context assembly
â”œâ”€â”€ ardour_midi_importer.py       # Ardour import
â”œâ”€â”€ track_manager.py              # Track management
â”œâ”€â”€ music_generator_cli.py        # Main CLI interface
â””â”€â”€ test_midi_generator.py        # Test suite
```

### Dependencies to Add
```txt
# Additional dependencies for MIDI to JSON
music21>=8.0.0
numpy>=1.21.0
```

## Target Workflow

### User Experience
```bash
# Basic generation
python music_generator_cli.py "generate a bass pattern like Alice In Chains in GMinor"

# Interactive mode
python music_generator_cli.py --interactive

# Context extraction
python music_generator_cli.py --extract-context
```

### Expected Flow
1. **User gives prompt**: "generate a bass pattern like Alice In Chains in GMinor"
2. **Extract context**: Get existing MIDI from Ardour project
3. **Convert to JSON**: Transform MIDI to musical notation JSON
4. **Send to OpenAI**: Include context and style reference
5. **Generate MIDI**: Create new MIDI pattern
6. **Import to Ardour**: Add to appropriate track

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1: Basic MIDI Generation
- [ ] Generate valid MIDI files from natural language prompts
- [ ] Handle style references (Alice In Chains, etc.)
- [ ] Create playable MIDI files
- [ ] Basic error handling and validation

### Phase 2: Context Extraction
- [ ] Extract MIDI from Ardour projects
- [ ] Convert to musical notation JSON
- [ ] Analyze musical context (key, tempo, style)
- [ ] Include context in OpenAI prompts

### Phase 3: Ardour Integration
- [ ] Import generated MIDI to Ardour
- [ ] Create appropriate tracks
- [ ] Handle track naming and organization
- [ ] Error recovery and user feedback

### Phase 4: Complete Workflow
- [ ] End-to-end workflow from prompt to Ardour
- [ ] Interactive mode for continuous conversation
- [ ] Context awareness across multiple generations
- [ ] User-friendly error messages and recovery

## Testing Strategy
