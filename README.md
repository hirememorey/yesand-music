## 🎵 Example Workflows

### MIDI to JSON Workflow (NEW - Target Implementation)
1. **Generate**: `python music_generator_cli.py "generate a bass pattern like Alice In Chains in GMinor"`
2. **Context**: System extracts existing MIDI from Ardour project
3. **Convert**: MIDI converted to musical notation JSON
4. **Generate**: OpenAI creates contextually appropriate bass pattern
5. **Import**: MIDI automatically imported to Ardour track

### Security-First Real-Time Enhancement
1. **Start**: `python secure_enhancement_cli.py --interactive`
2. **Enhance**: `enhance create a funky bassline` → Secure AI enhancement
3. **Check Status**: `status` → See system health and security status
4. **Refine**: `enhance make it more complex` → Iterative improvement
5. **Monitor**: System automatically monitors health and security

### Legacy Real-Time Ardour Enhancement with Auto-Import
1. **Start**: `python real_time_enhancement_cli.py --interactive`
2. **Enhance**: `enhance create a funky bassline` → Real-time LLM analysis
3. **Auto-Import**: Patterns automatically imported to Ardour tracks
4. **Check Status**: `imports` → See what was imported successfully
5. **Refine**: `enhance make it more complex` → Iterative improvement

### Live MIDI Creation
1. **Generate**: "Give me a funky bassline" → MIDI streams to Ardour
2. **Refine**: "Make it more complex" → Real-time modification
3. **Style**: "Make it groove like Bootsy Collins" → Style transformation
4. **Polish**: "Add some swing" → Final touches

### Musical Conversation
1. **Start**: "I need help with my jazz ballad"
2. **Analyze**: AI analyzes your entire project context
3. **Suggest**: "The piano is busy, try a simpler bassline"
4. **Generate**: Creates contextually appropriate bassline
5. **Refine**: "Make it darker" → Iterative improvement

### Problem Solving
1. **Load**: `load my_song.mid`
2. **Analyze**: `analyze all` → Complete musical analysis
3. **Improve**: `make this groove better` → Enhanced version
