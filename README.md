**Musical Conversation & Problem-Solving System with Context-Aware Intelligence**

Transform musical problem-solving from technical manipulation to intelligent conversation through guided context gathering and rapid testing capabilities. Built with dual context sources (project state + user input) for production-ready musical collaboration.

## üéâ NEW: Musical Conversation System

**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** **PRODUCTION READY**

The new Musical Conversation & Problem-Solving System addresses the critical insight that **musical quality is not a technical issue to solve, but a psychological one for the user to understand what they need and want**.

**Key Features:**
- **Guided Context Building**: Step-by-step help for describing musical vision
- **Dual Context Sources**: Project analysis + user input for complete understanding
- **Contextual Suggestions**: AI suggestions that actually fit musical context
- **Rapid Testing**: Quick MIDI sketches for immediate idea validation
- **Musical Reasoning**: Understand why suggestions work with existing parts

**See:** [MUSICAL_CONVERSATION_README.md](MUSICAL_CONVERSATION_README.md) for complete documentation.

**Status:** System ready for production use with comprehensive testing and documentation.

## üéµ Example Workflows

### Musical Conversation System (NEW - Production Ready)
1. **Start Conversation**: `python musical_conversation_cli.py --interactive`
2. **With Project**: `python musical_conversation_cli.py --interactive --project /path/to/project.mid`
3. **Run Demo**: `python musical_conversation_cli.py --demo`

**Example Conversation:**
```
üéµ You: I need help with a bridge that makes sense
ü§ñ AI: I understand your problem. Let me ask you some questions to provide the best suggestions:
    1. What key and tempo is your song in?
    2. What instruments do you already have?
    3. What musical style are you going for?

üéµ You: The key is G minor and tempo is 120 BPM
ü§ñ AI: Great! What instruments do you already have?

üéµ You: I have a DX7 bass line and fuzz guitar
ü§ñ AI: Perfect! Here are some bridge suggestions:
    1. Contrasting Key Bridge - Move to Bb major for tension
    2. Rhythmic Contrast Bridge - Change from straight to swung eighths
    Use 'test 1' to generate a MIDI sketch for testing.
```
