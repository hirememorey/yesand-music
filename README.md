## 🎵 Example Workflows

### MVP MIDI Generator (NEW - Available Now)
1. **Generate**: `python3 mvp_midi_generator.py "generate me a bass line in gminor as if Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam did a line of coke and just threw up prior to generating this"`
2. **Interactive**: `python3 mvp_midi_generator.py --interactive`
3. **Output File**: `python3 mvp_midi_generator.py "create a funky bass line" --output funky_bass.mid`

### MIDI to JSON Workflow (Target Implementation)
1. **Generate**: `python music_generator_cli.py "generate a bass pattern like Alice In Chains in GMinor"`
2. **Context**: System extracts existing MIDI from Ardour project
3. **Convert**: MIDI converted to musical notation JSON
4. **Generate**: OpenAI creates contextually appropriate bass pattern
5. **Import**: MIDI automatically imported to Ardour track
