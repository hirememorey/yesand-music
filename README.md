- **Iterative Refinement**: "Make it more complex" ‚Üí "This is too busy, simplify it"
- **Musical Intelligence**: Analyzes bass lines, melodies, harmony, and rhythm with visual feedback
- **Problem Solving**: "Make this groove better", "Fix the harmony", "Improve the arrangement"
- **Real-Time Control**: Generate MIDI patterns via natural language commands
- **DAW Integration**: Works with GarageBand, Logic Pro, and Ardour (with file-based integration)
- **Educational**: Learn musical concepts through AI explanations and musical references
