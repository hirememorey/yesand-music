**Enhanced Musical Conversation & Intent Discovery System**

Transform musical problem-solving from technical manipulation to intelligent conversation through natural dialogue, intent discovery, and context-aware creative enhancement.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**"Musical quality is not a technical issue to solve, but a psychological one for the user to understand what they need and want."**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenAI API key** (for AI features)

### Installation
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies

# 2. Set OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Try It Now

#### 🎵 Enhanced Musical Conversation System (PRIMARY)
```bash
# Demo mode (recommended - always works)
python enhanced_musical_conversation_cli.py --demo

# Interactive mode (with EOF error handling)
python enhanced_musical_conversation_cli.py --interactive

4. **Discover Intent**: System captures your musical vision through conversation
5. **Get Enhancements**: Receive creative suggestions based on your vision
6. **Generate Prompts**: Create detailed prompts for MIDI generation

**Example Conversation:**
```
🎵 You: I'm working on a jazz piece
🤖 AI: Welcome to your musical discovery session! I'm here to help you explore and clarify your musical vision...

🎵 You: It's in G minor at 120 BPM
🤖 AI: I understand you're working on G minor at 120 for harmonic...

🎵 You: I want a mysterious, dark sound like Miles Davis
🤖 AI: I picked up several musical ideas from what you said:
     - Timbral: mysterious, dark sound like Miles
     - Emotional: want a mysterious, dark sound
     
     💡 Musical Insights: Harmonic elements are well-defined, Emotional character is clear
```
