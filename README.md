**Contextual Intelligence for Semantic MIDI Editing with Visual Feedback**

YesAnd Music transforms MIDI editing from technical manipulation to intelligent assistance through natural language conversation that integrates seamlessly with existing DAW workflows.

## What It Does

- **Musical Intelligence**: Analyzes bass lines, melodies, harmony, and rhythm with visual feedback
- **Problem Solving**: "Make this groove better", "Fix the harmony", "Improve the arrangement"
- **Real-Time Control**: Generate MIDI patterns via natural language commands
- **DAW Integration**: Works with GarageBand, Logic Pro, and Ardour (with file-based integration)
- **Educational**: Learn musical concepts through AI explanations

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Setup (2 minutes)
python -c "import mido; print('Available ports:', mido.get_output_names())"
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run it
python main.py

# 3. Try musical intelligence
python control_plane_cli.py "load test_simple.mid"
python control_plane_cli.py "make this groove better"
```

**See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup instructions.**

## Current Status

âœ… **Phase 3B Complete**: Musical problem solvers working
