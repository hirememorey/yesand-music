# Musical Scribe Architecture

**Inspired by Sully.ai's Medical Scribe Model**

This document outlines the critical architectural evolution needed to transform YesAnd Music from a command-driven tool into a context-aware musical collaborator.

## 🎯 The Problem

The current YesAnd Music architecture is **command-driven** rather than **context-driven**, severely limiting its effectiveness:

### Current Approach (Limited)
```
User: "Give me a funky bassline"
System: Generates generic funky bassline
Result: Might not fit the song at all
```

### What We Need (Context-Aware)
```
User: "Give me a funky bassline"
System: Analyzes entire project → "This is a jazz ballad in C major with slow tempo and complex chords. The existing bass is too busy. Generate a simpler, more supportive bassline that complements the piano and vocals..."
Result: Contextually appropriate bassline that actually enhances the song
```

## 🏥 Sully.ai Architecture Model

Sully.ai's medical scribe works like this:
1. **Audio Input**: Doctor-patient interaction recorded
2. **Transcription**: Audio converted to text
3. **Context + Prompt**: Transcribed text + specialized medical prompt sent to LLM
4. **Structured Output**: LLM returns structured medical note

### Sully.ai Prompt Example
```
You are an expert medical scribe writing a clinical note for this interaction. 
You should structure the note with the following:

Assessment and Plan Section, please report the patient symptoms from the transcript...
```

## 🎵 Musical Scribe Architecture

### Core Concept
Transform YesAnd Music to work like Sully.ai's medical scribe, but for music:

1. **DAW Project Input**: Full project state (tracks, regions, arrangements)
2. **Musical Context**: Project converted to structured JSON with musical analysis
3. **Contextual Prompt**: Musical context + specialized prompt sent to LLM
4. **Enhanced MIDI**: LLM returns contextually appropriate MIDI patterns

### Musical Scribe Prompt Example
```
You are an expert bassist brought in to enhance this musical project.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Song: "My Jazz Ballad"
- Key: C major
- Tempo: 120 BPM
- Style: Jazz ballad with complex chord progression

EXISTING TRACKS:
- Piano: Complex jazz chords, busy right hand
- Drums: Soft brush pattern
- Vocals: Melodic line in upper register

MUSICAL ANALYSIS:
- Harmonic progression: Cmaj7 - Am7 - Dm7 - G7
- Rhythmic patterns: Syncopated piano, straight drum groove
- Arrangement: Sparse, needs bass foundation

CLIENT REQUEST: "Give me a funky bassline"

Please generate 2-3 different MIDI patterns that enhance this track while maintaining musical coherence with the existing arrangement.
```

## 🏗️ Implementation Architecture

### 1. Project State Parser
```python
class ProjectStateParser:
    def parse_daw_project(self, project_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:

    def enhance_music(self, project_path: str, user_request: str) -> List[MIDIPattern]:
        """Main entry point - like Sully.ai's scribe workflow"""
        
        # 1. Parse entire project state
        project_state = self.project_parser.parse_daw_project(project_path)
        
        # 2. Analyze musical context
        musical_context = self.context_engine.analyze_project_context(project_state)
        
        # 3. Build contextual prompt
        prompt = self.prompt_builder.build_prompt(project_state, musical_context, user_request)
        
        # 4. Send to LLM with project context
        response = self.llm_client.generate(
            prompt=prompt,
            context={
                "project_state": project_state,
                "musical_context": musical_context,
                "user_request": user_request
            },
            response_format="structured_midi_patterns"
