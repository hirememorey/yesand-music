- Security-first architecture with validation
- Context-aware prompt engineering
- Quality assessment and validation
- Style database with Jeff Ament/Pearl Jam characteristics

#### 2. **Musical Intelligence Engine** (`musical_intelligence_engine.py`)
- Analyzes prompts to extract musical context
- Identifies key, tempo, style, mood, and complexity
- Extracts style characteristics from artist references
- Builds comprehensive musical context

#### 3. **Context-Aware Prompt Builder** (`context_aware_prompts.py`)
- Builds intelligent prompts for OpenAI
- Incorporates musical context and style characteristics
- Optimizes prompts for better AI generation
- Validates prompt quality and completeness

#### 4. **Real-Time MIDI Generator** (`real_time_midi_generator.py`)
- Streaming generation with live updates
- Interactive modes for continuous conversation
- Progress feedback and error recovery
- Real-time quality assessment

#### 5. **MVP CLI Interface** (`mvp_midi_generator.py`)
- Simple command-line interface
- Interactive mode for continuous generation
- Single command mode for batch processing
- Help system and examples

## üéØ **Exact User Request Fulfilled**

The system successfully handles the exact prompt:
> "generate me a bass line in gminor as if Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam did a line of coke and just threw up prior to generating this"

**What it does:**
1. **Analyzes** the prompt to extract:
   - Key: G minor
   - Instrument: Bass
   - Style: Jeff Ament/Pearl Jam
   - Mood: Energetic, chaotic, raw
   - Complexity: Medium to high

2. **Builds** a context-aware prompt that includes:
   - Musical context (G minor, 120 BPM, 4/4 time)
   - Style characteristics (raw, energetic, syncopated, aggressive)
   - Jeff Ament-specific techniques (slides, hammer-ons, palm muting)
   - Pearl Jam aesthetic (grunge, alternative rock)

3. **Generates** MIDI data using OpenAI that captures:
   - Jeff Ament's bass style characteristics
   - Energetic and chaotic feel
   - G minor harmonic context
   - Appropriate bass techniques

4. **Outputs** a MIDI file that can be imported into any DAW

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Highlights**

## üß™ **Testing Results**

All tests pass successfully:
- ‚úÖ Import tests
- ‚úÖ Musical Intelligence Engine
- ‚úÖ Context-Aware Prompt Builder
- ‚úÖ AI MIDI Generator
- ‚úÖ Real-Time MIDI Generator
- ‚úÖ MVP Generator
- ‚úÖ CLI Interface

## üöÄ **Ready for First User Testing**

The MVP is now ready for you to test! Here's how to use it:

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Generate MIDI with the exact prompt
python3 mvp_midi_generator.py "generate me a bass line in gminor as if Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam did a line of coke and just threw up prior to generating this"

# Or try interactive mode
python3 mvp_midi_generator.py --interactive
```

### **Expected Output**
- **File**: `bass_jeff_ament_gm_minor_[timestamp].mid`
- **Content**: 2-4 bar bass line in G minor
- **Style**: Jeff Ament/Pearl Jam characteristics with energetic, chaotic feel
- **Quality**: Professional enough to use in a DAW

## üéµ **Example Usage**

```bash
# Basic generation
python3 mvp_midi_generator.py "create a funky bass line in C major"

# With output file
python3 mvp_midi_generator.py "jazz drum pattern" --output jazz_drums.mid

# With context
python3 mvp_midi_generator.py "melancholic melody" --context '{"tempo": 80, "key": "A minor"}'

# Interactive mode
python3 mvp_midi_generator.py --interactive
```
