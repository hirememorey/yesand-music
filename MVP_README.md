# MVP MIDI Generator

**AI-Powered MIDI Generation from Natural Language**

This is the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) implementation of the YesAnd Music system, designed to generate MIDI files from natural language prompts using OpenAI's GPT models.

## 🎯 What This MVP Does

Given a prompt like:
> "generate me a bass line in gminor as if Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam did a line of coke and just threw up prior to generating this"

The system will:
1. **Analyze** the prompt to extract musical context (key, tempo, style, mood)
2. **Build** a context-aware prompt for OpenAI
3. **Generate** MIDI data using AI
4. **Output** a MIDI file that can be imported into any DAW

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip3 install --break-system-packages mido openai

# Set OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Usage

#### Single Generation
```bash
python3 mvp_midi_generator.py "generate me a bass line in gminor as if Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam did a line of coke and just threw up prior to generating this"
```

#### Interactive Mode
```bash
python3 mvp_midi_generator.py --interactive
```

#### With Output File
```bash
python3 mvp_midi_generator.py "create a funky bass line" --output funky_bass.mid
```

#### With Context
```bash
python3 mvp_midi_generator.py "jazz drum pattern" --context '{"tempo": 140, "key": "C major"}'
```

## 🎵 Example Prompts

- `"generate me a bass line in gminor as if Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam did a line of coke and just threw up prior to generating this"`
- `"create a funky bass line in C major"`
- `"make a jazz drum pattern in 4/4 time"`
- `"generate a melancholic melody in A minor"`
- `"create a rock bass line with aggressive attack"`

## 🏗️ Architecture

The MVP consists of 5 main components:

### 1. Musical Intelligence Engine (`musical_intelligence_engine.py`)
- Analyzes natural language prompts
- Extracts musical context (key, tempo, style, mood)
- Identifies style characteristics and preferences

### 2. Context-Aware Prompt Builder (`context_aware_prompts.py`)
- Builds intelligent prompts for OpenAI
- Incorporates musical context and style characteristics
- Optimizes prompts for better AI generation

### 3. AI MIDI Generator (`ai_midi_generator.py`)
- Integrates with OpenAI's GPT models
- Generates MIDI data from enhanced prompts
- Validates and assesses quality of generated content

### 4. Real-Time MIDI Generator (`real_time_midi_generator.py`)
- Provides streaming generation with live updates
- Supports interactive modes
- Handles progress feedback and error recovery

### 5. MVP CLI Interface (`mvp_midi_generator.py`)
- Main command-line interface
- Integrates all components
- Provides user-friendly experience

## 🎨 Style Database

The system includes a built-in style database with:

### Jeff Ament (Pearl Jam)
- **Characteristics**: Raw, energetic bass lines, syncopated rhythms, aggressive attack
- **Tempo Range**: 80-140 BPM
- **Key Preferences**: Minor, Dorian, Mixolydian
- **Techniques**: Slides, hammer-ons, palm muting, power chords

### Pearl Jam
- **Characteristics**: Grunge rock foundation, alternative rock sensibilities
- **Tempo Range**: 70-160 BPM
- **Key Preferences**: Minor, Dorian, Mixolydian, Major
- **Techniques**: Power chords, melodic bass, dynamic contrast

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Security-First Architecture
- Built-in input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Secure API communication

### Musical Intelligence
- Context-aware prompt engineering
- Style characteristic analysis
- Mood and complexity detection

### Quality Assessment
- Generated content validation
- Style accuracy scoring
- Musical coherence assessment

## 📊 Output Format

Generated MIDI files use the universal note format:
```json
{
    "pitch": 36,                    // MIDI note number (0-127)
    "velocity": 80,                 // Note velocity (0-127)
    "start_time_seconds": 0.0,      // Start time in seconds
    "duration_seconds": 0.5,        // Note duration in seconds
    "track_index": 0                // Track number
}
```
