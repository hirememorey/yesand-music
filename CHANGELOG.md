    - `save_midi_file()`: Saves note dictionaries back to MIDI files
    - Universal data structure: `{'pitch': int, 'velocity': int, 'start_time_seconds': float, 'duration_seconds': float, 'track_index': int}`
    - No heavy dependencies - avoids "Black Box Dependency Problem"
    - Comprehensive validation and error handling
  - **`project.py`**: Clean Project class for musical data management
    - `Project` class as container for musical data and metadata
    - `load_from_midi()` and `save_to_midi()` methods using midi_io functions

    - Separation of concerns - pure data management without musical analysis logic
    - Prevents "Spaghetti Code Problem" through clean, focused design
  - **`analysis.py`**: Musical analysis and transformation functions
    - `filter_notes_by_pitch()`: Filter notes by pitch range for bass line analysis
    - `apply_swing()`: Apply swing feel by delaying off-beat notes
    - Pure functions with no side effects - avoids "Spaghetti Code Problem"
    - Foundation for semantic MIDI editing transformations

#### Fixed
- **Critical: Non-blocking MIDI Playback**: Fixed blocking issue where `MidiPlayer.send_note()` used `time.sleep()` preventing real-time operation. Now uses timer-based note-off events for truly non-blocking playback.
- **CC Command Execution**: Fixed mido import issue in control commands (CC and modulation wheel now work correctly).
- **Ardour panner plugin discovery**: Resolved "No panner found" fatal error by adding the missing `ARDOUR_PANNER_PATH` environment variable. Ardour uses a dedicated `ARDOUR_PANNER_PATH` variable (not just `ARDOUR_DLL_PATH`) to discover panner plugins. The launch script now correctly sets both variables for complete plugin discovery.
#### Changed
- `docs/ARDOUR_SETUP.md`: Replaced `--no-ytk` external GTK route with the successful internal YTK path on macOS. Documented clean configure with `env - i`, `--keepflags`, `CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS="-DNO_SYMBOL_RENAMING -DNO_SYMBOL_EXPORT -DDISABLE_VISIBILITY"`, SDKROOT=14.x, deployment target 11.0, and proof gates ("Use YTK instead of GTK: True"). Added artifact locations and run commands.
- `docs/ARDOUR_SETUP.md`: Overhauled the launch section with a detailed explanation of the multi-system environment (Ardour vs. GTK), the need for pre-flight configuration, and the construction of exhaustive, non-recursive search paths for data and plugins.
- `launch_ardour.sh`: The script is now a definitive system orchestrator that correctly sets up the GTK, Ardour Data, and Ardour DLL environments for a stable launch.
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`: Added a new section for diagnosing common Ardour launch failures, explaining the root cause of each and pointing to the correct solution.
