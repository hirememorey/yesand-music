## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (for AI features)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd music_cursor

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Test Everything Works
```bash
# Test the enhanced conversation system
python enhanced_musical_conversation_cli.py --demo

# Test security-first system
python secure_enhancement_cli.py --status

# Test core functionality
python test_simple_functionality.py
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Try the Demo
```bash
python enhanced_musical_conversation_cli.py --demo
```
This runs a simulated conversation showing how the system works.

### 2. Start Interactive Mode
```bash
python enhanced_musical_conversation_cli.py --interactive
```
This starts an interactive conversation where you can describe your musical vision.

### 3. With Initial Input
```bash
python enhanced_musical_conversation_cli.py --interactive --input "I'm working on a jazz piece"
```
This starts with your initial musical idea.

## How It Works

### 1. Intent Discovery
The system asks questions to understand your musical vision:
- What style/genre are you working in?
- What tempo and key signature?
- What instrument are you generating for?
- What mood or feeling should it convey?

### 2. Creative Enhancement
Based on your responses, the system suggests creative enhancements:
- Rhythmic improvements
- Harmonic extensions
- Melodic development
- Timbral enhancements

### 3. Prompt Generation
The system creates rich, contextual prompts for MIDI generation that capture your complete musical vision.

## Example Conversation

```
üéµ You: I'm working on a jazz piece
ü§ñ AI: Welcome to your musical discovery session! I'm here to help you explore and clarify your musical vision...

üéµ You: It's in G minor at 120 BPM
ü§ñ AI: I understand you're working on G minor at 120 for harmonic...

üéµ You: I want a mysterious, dark sound like Miles Davis
ü§ñ AI: I picked up several musical ideas from what you said:
     - Timbral: mysterious, dark sound like Miles
     - Emotional: want a mysterious, dark sound
     
     üí° Musical Insights: Harmonic elements are well-defined, Emotional character is clear

üéµ You: Swung eighths for the rhythm
ü§ñ AI: I picked up several musical ideas from what you said:
     - Rhythmic: for the rhythm, Swung eighths for, Swung eighths for the
     
     üí° Musical Insights: You have a clear rhythmic vision, Harmonic elements are well-defined
```

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **Import Errors**: Make sure you're in the correct directory and have activated the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   cd music_cursor
   ```

### Getting Help
