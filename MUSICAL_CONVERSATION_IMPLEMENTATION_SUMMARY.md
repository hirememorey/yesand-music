## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow
```bash
# Start interactive conversation

# With project analysis
python musical_conversation_cli.py --interactive --project /path/to/project.mid

# Run comprehensive demo
python musical_conversation_cli.py --demo
```

### Example Conversation
```
üéµ You: I need help with a bridge that makes sense

ü§ñ AI: I understand your problem: I need help with a bridge that makes sense

Let me provide some suggestions based on your musical context. Could you also tell me:
1. What key and tempo is your song in?
2. What instruments do you already have?
3. What musical style are you going for?

üéµ You: The key is G minor and tempo is 120 BPM

ü§ñ AI: Great! I can see you have a G minor song at 120 BPM. What instruments do you already have?

üéµ You: I have a DX7 bass line and fuzz guitar

ü§ñ AI: Perfect! So you have a G minor song at 120 BPM with DX7 bass and fuzz guitar. What's the song about?

üéµ You: It's about leaders who shoot the messenger instead of fixing problems

ü§ñ AI: Excellent! Now I have a complete picture. Here are some bridge suggestions:

1. Contrasting Key Bridge
   Move to Bb major to create tension and contrast with your G minor verses
   Musical reasoning: The relative major (Bb) of G minor provides harmonic contrast
   Confidence: 85%

2. Rhythmic Contrast Bridge
   Change from straight eighth notes to swung eighth notes for variety
   Musical reasoning: Rhythmic contrast provides interest without changing harmony
   Confidence: 75%

Use 'test 1' to generate a MIDI sketch for testing.
