# Roadmap: Visual-First Semantic MIDI Editing

This document outlines the implementation roadmap for transforming YesAnd Music from a chat-driven MIDI control system into a sophisticated visual-first semantic MIDI editing platform.

## Vision

Enable visual, immediate feedback musical editing through:
- **Visual Pattern Recognition**: Highlight bass lines, melodies, chord progressions in real-time
- **Interactive MIDI Manipulation**: Drag-and-drop musical elements with instant audio feedback
- **Smart Visual Suggestions**: Show musical improvements with one-click application
- **Seamless DAW Integration**: Work within familiar DAW workflows, not against them

## Strategic Pivot: From Command-Based to Visual-First

**Critical Insight from Pre-Mortem Analysis**: Musicians are visual, immediate feedback creatures who work in familiar DAW environments. A command-based interface breaks their fundamental workflow of see-hear-adjust.

**New Approach**: Build a visual analysis and manipulation system that integrates seamlessly with existing DAW workflows while providing intelligent musical insights and suggestions.
