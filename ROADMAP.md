# Roadmap: Contextual Intelligence for Semantic MIDI Editing with Visual Feedback

This document outlines the implementation roadmap for transforming YesAnd Music from a chat-driven MIDI control system into an intelligent, contextual assistant that enhances musical creativity through natural language conversation and on-demand visual feedback without disrupting existing DAW workflows.

## Vision

Enable intelligent, contextual musical assistance through:
- **Background Musical Analysis**: Silent, continuous analysis that doesn't interrupt workflow
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Understand what musicians are working on with on-demand visual feedback
- **Natural Language Conversation**: Chat with AI assistant for musical guidance and complex operations
- **Visual Learning**: On-demand visual feedback that helps musicians understand and learn
- **Workflow Preservation**: Enhance existing DAW workflows without disrupting them
- **Educational Value**: Help musicians learn musical concepts through visual explanations

## Strategic Pivot: From Invisible to Contextual Intelligence
